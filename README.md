## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install

   ```

3. Add ts-node if not there

   ````
   ```bash
   yarn add ts-node
   ````

4. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

5. Install frontend dependencies using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

6. Return to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

7. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend and start the project:
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

Now you should be able to access the application locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
